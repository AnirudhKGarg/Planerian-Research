## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:




```{r}
#import library
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)

```

```{r}
#import dataset
data <- read_excel("Planerian Data Bio 1406.xlsx")
#data is the name of your dataset
data

```
```{r}
#I remove the spaces in the names of the columns and replace them with underscores
colnames(data) <- gsub(" ", "_", colnames(data))
#new dataframe called df has the correct format
df <- data %>% select(starts_with("Week"))

df


```
```{r}
#this is a nova-Welsh test run them in sperate cells (cmd + option + I on mac) and change the names
#Week1 should always be group 1 (first arg in the t.test () function)
t.test(df$Week_1_C, df$Week_1_L, var.equal = FALSE, alternative = "greater")


```



```{r}

# Create a series of bar graphs
ggplot(df, aes(x = df$Week_1_C, y = df$Week_1_L)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +
  labs(x = "Time", y = "Mean Length") +
  ggtitle("Mena Length Across Time") +
  facet_wrap(~Group, ncol = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))



```
